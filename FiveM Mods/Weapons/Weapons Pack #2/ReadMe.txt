-------------------------------------------------

Use the provided in-game menu in order to spawn in your add-on weapons by following these instructions:

- Once loaded into your game, press your "M" Key to open the Menu.

- Scroll down to "Player Related Options" > "Weapon Options" > "Add-On Weapons"

I've neatly organized all of the weapons for your convenience, categorized by the genre of each weapon.

If you already have vMenu, be sure to copy and paste the 'addons.json' from the vMenu that I've provided!

-------------------------------------------------

If you are encountering issues spawning any weapons, there may be other custom weapon files with 
conflicting weapon metas. Please disable any conflicting weapons in order to resolve this issue.

-------------------------------------------------

Configurations can be found in the vMenu script, under the "config" folder.
From there you can add/remove weapons from the menu, setup permissions for each individual weapon and more!
